# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Can you survive?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This will be a choose your own adventure game that is going to be based around the hit CBS Show, Survivor.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will include a series of challenges, comparable to the challenges that the survivors have to go through on the show. I am hoping to create games such as hangman, random number guessers, trivia, etc. The basis of the entire project will be a lot of nested if/else functions. The user will be given choices throughout the game and will either win or get knocked out based on their choices.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have a complete, functioning game where the user can win or lose. Something that will be enjoyable for the user.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having a complete, functioning game that consists of mini-games and can whiddle down from 16 to one survivors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this project would be to have a complete, functioning game that is engaging and takes around 5-10 mins to complete. I would love to make the challenges very in depth and entertaining, but the time restriction might limit my ability to do that.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills I will need to acquire for this assignment will be gained through watching Youtube videos about choose your own adventure. I also will need to touch up on my if/else statement skills. I will be creating the entire project myself.
